# System-first review taxonomy

Use the Foundation portion to reason about atomic categories within the module-first workflow. The five static and four dynamic layers below are an **extended taxonomy** for a separately requested component/behavior review; they are not the default Product B page outline. Module discovery, global reconnaissance and batch gates are defined in `SKILL.md` and [module-governance.md](module-governance.md); global framework rules are in [foundation-decision-guide.md](foundation-decision-guide.md). The scanner is an evidence engine; it does not define the target standard.

## Review rules

- In an extended review, render every applicable layer and category, including `not-detected` and `unverified` categories. In default Product B, render every atomic category without manufacturing component sections.
- Organize initial issues by business module and atomic category, with shared-owner issues linked once. Organize the global framework by atomic category. Never make scanner rules, severity or file types the primary user-facing outline.
- Treat accessibility, responsive behavior, ownership, scope, and runtime verification as cross-cutting quality gates.
- Do not infer a healthy system from the absence of findings.
- Do not infer semantic equivalence from equal values.
- Do not infer a target appearance from source evidence alone. Use rendered product evidence or ask the user to decide.
- Keep source paths, excerpts, fingerprints, and raw counts in collapsed engineer details.

## Dynamic system: four layers

Dynamic categories are horizontal behavior contracts applied to the static component inventory. Do not duplicate the atomic hierarchy.

### 1. Interaction foundation

- State vocabulary and precedence: default, hover, focus, active, selected, disabled, loading, invalid, success, empty.
- Input modalities: pointer, touch, keyboard, shortcuts, long press and double click where applicable.
- Feedback contract: visual, text, sound, haptics and assistive-technology announcements.
- Motion rules: feedback, guidance, continuity, enter/exit, interruption and reduced motion.

### 2. Component behavior

- Activation, selection and value changes.
- Input, formatting, validation timing and error recovery.
- Keyboard navigation, focus movement and focus-visible behavior.
- Disclosure, opening, closing and dismissal.
- Async loading, success, failure, retry and cancellation.

### 3. Cross-component orchestration

- Portal ownership, anchor boundaries, collision handling and semantic layer order.
- Focus trap, roving focus, initial focus and trigger restoration.
- Body/container scroll lock, scroll restoration and virtual scrolling.
- Modal stack, Toast queue, Tooltip provider, Theme/Locale/Density providers.
- Drag/drop, pointer capture, gestures, cancellation and keyboard alternatives.

### 4. Flow and lifecycle

- Loading, optimistic updates, rollback, recovery and cancellation.
- Routing, back navigation, focus restoration and scroll restoration.
- Draft/session/route persistence and refresh behavior.
- Breakpoint, viewport, orientation, keyboard and safe-area adaptation.
- Permission, authentication, timeout, offline and network changes.
- Screen-reader announcements, reduced motion, interruptibility and runtime performance.

## Leaf-category contract

For an **extended** component or behavior review, each applicable leaf category needs these information types; they may be collapsed or rearranged to keep the actual visual comparison dominant. Default atomic governance across B and C instead follows the stage gates in `SKILL.md`:

1. **Standard definition**: what a healthy design system should define.
2. **Current inventory**: definitions, unique values, owners, usages, bypasses, scopes, variants and runtime coverage as applicable.
3. **Current visual or state model**: swatches, specimens, state matrix, layer stack or flow.
4. **Gap**: missing, duplicated, fragmented, conflicting, bypassed, scoped exception or unverified.
5. **Target model**: the proposed hierarchy, names, roles, owners and visual/behavior result.
6. **Recommendation**: keep, consolidate, alias, adapt, migrate, deprecate, preserve an exception or verify at runtime.
7. **User decision**: explicit choices with concise consequences.
8. **Engineer evidence**: collapsed paths, code excerpts, fingerprints and raw scanner output.

On decision cards, render the current and target elements as the largest surfaces. Collapse the standard definition, gap explanation, limitations, and engineer evidence after using them to derive one short question and one recommendation. Never repeat the same point in multiple visible paragraphs.

## Designer-facing presentation contract

Present each category as a design-library specification sheet, not as a scanner dashboard:

1. Lead with the category name, its product purpose, and a plain status sentence.
2. Show the current product as visible specimens or a matrix. Use the axes that designers actually compare: role, variant, hierarchy, size, state, density, theme, mode, or composition.
3. Place dark/light, desktop/mobile, default/hover/focus/disabled, or other relevant modes side by side when evidence exists. Mark absent or unverified cells instead of inventing them.
4. Put the proposed target beside or immediately after the current system. Use source-derived values only; otherwise describe the structural contract and the decision still needed.
5. End with an explicit keep, merge, replace, scope, or verify recommendation and a user decision where judgment is required.
6. Keep raw definition counts, paths, syntax, and code in optional engineer evidence. Counts may support a conclusion, but must never be the visual hierarchy of the page.

The default review first establishes the module map and read-only global reconnaissance, then a shared atomic framework with editable semantic definitions and underlying source bindings. Categories are confirmed globally and versioned; contextual mapping, differences and lifecycle decisions then run in small module batches. No module rebuilds its own competing global framework. Export lives in the relevant review surface; visual evidence contributes to Product D; interim acceptance is recorded in Product C. A routine migration row is evidence inside a batch, not a separate user prompt. Extended component/behavior work must not override these gates.

Never render silent blanks. If current source evidence is absent, say so explicitly while showing a minimal target-framework draft with unverified slots, not an invented complete contract. In an extended review, every common component preview must show recognizable content and evidenced states rather than an unlabeled outline.

When no shared component candidates are detected, classify the condition before recommending construction:

- scanner miss: a framework or generated owner exists outside the initial rules; expand discovery;
- implicit system: repeated product patterns exist without shared owners; propose extraction and consolidation;
- genuine absence: present a minimal Starter UIKit proposal for approval, but do not create source components during Review.

When a partial system exists, prefer its qualified owners and fill contract gaps. Do not build a parallel system merely because some standard nodes are missing.

Foundation categories should resemble foundation specification sheets. Atom and molecule categories should resemble component specification sheets with anatomy, variants, sizes, content combinations, and states. Components and patterns should show realistic compositions and responsive or lifecycle variants. Dynamic categories should use state matrices, transition sequences, focus/layer diagrams, and coordinated behavior tables.

## Foundation workbench reference implementations

The Color workbench below is the most detailed reference, but it is not the only foundation category that deserves a visual review. When source evidence exists, render these additional workbenches:

- **Typography:** show current font families and source-derived type combinations, then a project-derived target scale and weight strategy for whole-framework confirmation. Only after confirmation fill contextual mappings, direct typography bypasses, and governance actions. Use supplied references for layout and category logic, not as fixed values. Derive target sizes, line heights, weights, scopes, and usage from the repository; separate shared UI scales from product-scoped display, marketing, editor, numeric, and brand typography. Show real specimens and observed product locations. Group raw CSS and utility bypasses by font size, line height, weight, family, letter spacing, style, and other typography; attach occurrence counts, files, product locations, and a prefilled convergence action without truncation.
- **Spacing and density:** compare base scale, component inset, component gap, layout spacing, control size, and density modes; render each real length as a bounded bar or box; keep deliberate geometry distinct from reusable spacing decisions.
- **Shape and stroke:** compare radius, border width/style, dividers, and focus rings; render real corners and strokes; do not confuse border colors with stroke-width contracts.
- **Depth and layer:** compare shadow/elevation, scrim opacity, blur, and semantic z-index; render real shadow and opacity specimens and list layer values; keep visual elevation and runtime stacking-context ownership as separate checks.
- **Icons and assets:** separate package libraries, owned SVG collections, imported assets, inline SVGs, and Icon/Image/Avatar components; compare detected grid, stroke, and fill conventions; prefer a real library or owned collection as the source candidate, not the most frequent inline usage.

Every atomic workbench reuses the globally confirmed framework and source-binding revision. Within a selected module batch, show source-backed mappings and bypasses, framework differences, lifecycle decisions and collapsed engineer evidence, then return the round receipt after review/execution. Missing roles remain explicit; exact target values are never invented.

## Color reference implementation

The color workflow spans four artifacts, not six tabs in Product B. Keep it visual and compact: stage 1 belongs to A, stages 2-3 to B, stages 4-5 to C, and final verified stage 6 to D. Use this order:

1. Factual overview and source-derived primitive palette: group every unique rendered value into neutral, brand/action, feedback, and remaining candidates. If any view is truncated for performance, show displayed and total counts explicitly. Convert readable primitive literals and report labels to uppercase `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA`; keep `var()` aliases intact.
2. Editable global target framework: background, text, stroke color, icon, brand/action, feedback, data visualization, and evidenced scoped roles. Record name, meaning, intended locations and proposed underlying library/primitive bindings. Hide next-stage value columns in a structure-only review; the user can add, edit, remove or disable a slot and review evidenced theme bindings when ready.
3. Category confirmation and version lock: show what the category covers and what remains intentionally outside it. Record Framework v1; later additions become v2 differences with mapping impact.
4. Source-backed fill and coverage: in each module batch, map old occurrences to confirmed roles and verify the approved underlying light/dark bindings. Use a deep-gray dark canvas (`#1C1C1C`) and a light-gray light canvas (`#F5F5F3`); a checkerboard means transparency. Missing resolution has an explicit label, never a blank swatch pretending to render. Keep subcategory headings outside tables.
5. Difference and direct-color review: for candidates outside the framework, offer existing-role reuse, versioned addition, scoped exception, or unresolved. Group UI literal occurrences by canonical rendered color plus scene, feature, state, and scope. Show raw occurrence count separately from governance-cluster count. Exclude colors embedded inside illustrations, logos, decorative SVGs, raster images, and other graphic assets; review those objects only in the asset catalog.
6. Governance result: compact migrate, merge, delete, exception, and unresolved-semantic counts. Keep lifecycle lists and source evidence collapsed by default.

Only after framework confirmation may the Skill prefill migration mappings. Proposed underlying style bindings may be reviewed during framework definition, but are distinct from old-to-new mappings and observed implementation. Ask users about genuine missing roles, incompatible candidates or intentional scopes. Persist choices in shared project records, using JSON export/import as the current offline fallback.

Always distinguish these counts:

- Definition files.
- Canonical definitions.
- Unique rendered values.
- References/usages.
- Name-declared brand, primary, secondary and tertiary roles, kept separate from observed usage.
- Hardcoded occurrences and files.
- Selectors or classes that assign color.
- Same-value/different-name groups.
- Same-name/different-value groups.
- Theme, brand, application and page scope definitions.
- Undefined references and unassessed runtime usage.

Do not determine `primary` from a name alone. Compare declared roles with observed usage in primary actions and brand emphasis when rendered screens are available. Report the difference as declared versus observed.

Render the current color system as:

1. A direct conclusion: whether a real primitive palette exists, whether semantic roles exist, how many independent canonical color sources exist, and whether global usage is governed.
2. User-named palette lanes such as global candidate, theme or brand colors, likely legacy colors, and unconfirmed sources. Keep file paths secondary.
3. Implementation approaches attached to those sources. CSS Variables, Tailwind, and JS/TS are representations, not automatically separate systems.
4. Role comparison for brand, action hierarchy, background, surface, content, border, feedback, interaction, and data-visualization colors. Show missing roles explicitly.
5. Hardcoded-value hotspots grouped by actual rendered value, with an evidence-backed target mapping or an explicit “unmapped” state.
6. Keep, merge, alias, deprecate, or scoped-exception recommendations at both source and Token-family level.
7. A source-derived target preview that uses real candidate values and visibly marks roles that still require product decisions or runtime verification.

Render the target model as:

```text
Primitive palette
  -> Semantic roles
      -> background / surface / content / border
      -> action primary / secondary / tertiary
      -> success / warning / error / info
      -> hover / pressed / selected / disabled / focus
          -> Component Tokens
```

This diagram names possible role families, not a checklist of mandatory Tokens. Instantiate only the roles and states justified by the product and confirmed in the framework.

Keep data-visualization, brand and product scopes explicit instead of silently flattening them into ordinary UI color roles. Illustration and graphic-asset internals are outside the Color system and belong only to asset governance.

The target is a shared semantic color contract with explicit product scopes, not one flat palette of literal values. Light/dark themes, brands, applications, and data visualization may preserve different values when they map through explicit roles and scopes. Illustration internals remain asset content, not UI Color Tokens.

## Status and verification language

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `detected` | Source evidence exists. This is not a health claim. |
| `partial` | A system exists but has bypasses, incomplete coverage or adapters without a complete contract. |
| `fragmented` | Multiple owners, conflicts or incompatible systems require a decision. |
| `missing` | The product uses values or behavior without an identified governing system. |
| `not-detected` | No source evidence was found; confirm whether the category is applicable. |
| `unverified` | Runtime, rendered, accessibility or product evidence is required. |

Use `source-verified`, `runtime-verified`, `inferred`, and `unassessed` as separate evidence labels. Confidence is secondary metadata, never the user-facing conclusion.
